This folder contains some examples.

C_cubic: 
Diamond in a simple cubic cell. To keep the amount of data low, 
only single k-point was included. For test purposes only.
First, PCA is calculated and then LDOS for a set of 50 energies.
SOC was included, so SPINCASE = 3 in DENSITYTOOL.IN

Ni_fcc:
Ni in a fcc cell. To obtained the self-consistent charge
density, input files from the VASP wiki
https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Fcc_Ni_(revisited)
were used. The electronic structure was then recalculated
non-selfconsistently on a 4x4x4 k-point mesh to reduce 
the amount of data.
ISPIN = 2, so SPINCASE = 2 was used in this example.
1) PCA folder: Results of the simpler PCA / PSA method,
which clearly fails here, as the spin-polarized energies
are strongly split close to the Fermi energy. 
PCA and PSA was calculated, followed by LDOS and LSDOS
for 100 energy values.
Note that the results in ldos.png and lsdos.png strongly 
disagree with ldosmag.png and lsdosmag.png (in the PARCHGSPIN
folder), respectively.
2) PARCHGSPIN folder: Results of the PARCHGSPIN method where
spin-up and spin-down energies are treated directly.
PARCHGSPIN was calculated first. Then we calculated
LDOSMAG and LSDOSMAG. Finally, CHGCARSPIN and CHGCARAVG
was also calculated.
Note that the result in LDOS (ldosmag.png) and LSDOS (lsdosmag.png)
agree well with the DOS figure from the VASP wiki.

NiO_AFM:
NiO in antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. To obtained the self-consistent
charge density and electronic structure, input files from the VASP
wiki https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/NiO were used. 
ISPIN = 2, so SPINCASE = 2 was used in this example.
1) PCA folder: Results of the simpler PCA / PSA method, in this case
the approximation is exact, as the spin-polarized energies are not 
split for any level, due to the AFM state. 
PCA and PSA was calculated, followed by LDOS and LSDOS for 240 energy
values.
Note that the results in ldos.png and lsdos.png agree perfectly with
ldosmag.png and lsdosmag.png (in the PARCHGSPIN folder), respectively.
2) PARCHGSPIN folder: Results of the PARCHGSPIN method where
spin-up and spin-down energies are treated directly.
PARCHGSPIN was calculated first. Then we calculated
LDOSMAG and LSDOSMAG. Finally, CHGCARSPIN and CHGCARAVG
was also calculated.
Note that the result in LDOS (ldosmag.png) and LSDOS (lsdosmag.png)
agree perfectly with the PCA / PSA ones.
Also both agree well with the DOS figure from the VASP wiki.

Si_F6:
Hydrogenated Si with adsorbed F6 molecule. Structure from 
H. Wang et al., Adv. Electr. Mater. 5, 1800891 (2019). Electronic
structure calculated with the LMBJ XC potential and described in
T. Rauch et al., JCTC 17, 4746 (2021).
For the example, only the in-plane averaged data is supplied
(PARCHG.nnnn.kkkk.ALPHA.R3) and LDOS is calculated with LDOSMAG 
treating the spin-up and spin-down energies exactly. Note that
only the head of CHGCAR is provided, since the actual data is
not necessary in the current example.

MAPI:
CH3NH3PbI3, also known as MAPI, perovskite (2x2)x6 slab models for 
(001) MAI- and PbI2-terminated surfaces. Structures from ACS Omega
2020, 5, 45, 29477â€“29491. Electronic structure was calculated with
HSE06 hybrid functional and SOC.
For the example, only the in-plane averaged data is supplied
(PARCHG.nnnn.0001.R3) and LDOS is calculated with LDOS routine in
the SPINCASE=3. Note that only the head of CHGCAR is provided, since
the actual data is not necessary in the current example.
The data plotted was the LDOS.R3.all.dat file, which was created as
a compilation of individual LDOS data by means of:
cat LDOS.R3.0*.dat > LDOS.R3.all.dat

Ca_2N:
Ca_2N layered electride. The geometry was obtained from Materials
Project (see CIF: Conventional Standard): 
https://materialsproject.org/materials/mp-2686/#
We use a minimal INCAR file, with ENCUT = 600 eV, ISPIN = 1 (so 
SPINCASE = 1) and a 13x13x1 Gamma centered kpoint grid.

This folder contains some examples.

C_cubic: 
Diamond in a simple cubic cell. To keep the amount of data low, 
only single k-point was included. For test purposes only.
First, PCA is calculated and then LDOS for a set of 50 energies.
SOC was included, so SPINCASE = 3 in DENSITYTOOL.IN

Ni_fcc:
Ni in a fcc cell. To obtained the self-consistent charge
density, input files from the VASP wiki
https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Fcc_Ni_(revisited)
were used. The electronic structure was then recalculated
non-selfconsistently on a 4x4x4 k-point mesh to reduce 
the amount of data.
ISPIN=2, so SPINCASE = 2 was used in this example.
1) PCA folder: Results of the simpler PCA / PSA method,
which clearly fails here, as the spin-polarized energies
are strongly split close to the Fermi energy. 
PCA and PSA was calculated, followed by LDOS and LSDOS
for 100 energy values.
Note that the results in ldos.png and lsdos.png strongly 
disagree with ldosmag.png and lsdosmag.png (in the PARCHG folder),
respectively.
2) PARCHG folder: Results of the PARCHGSPIN method where
spin-up and spin-down energies are treated directly.
PARCHGSPIN was calculated first. Then we calculated
LDOSMAG and LSDOSMAG. Finally, CHGCARSPIN and CHGCARAVG
was also calculated.
Note that the result in LDOS (ldosmag.png) and LSDOS (lsdosmag.png)
agree well with the DOS figure from the VASP wiki.
